**Self Evaluation**

*Functionality*

The functionality of this program has reached through the file IO stage. The CLI is smooth and as required. I did not get to the cracking the code portion of the requirements.


*OOP*

I believe I have broken up this project into logical parts that make sense to not only me but to someone reviewing the code, even years down the line. My choice to group the shift and offset functions into the Key class was deliberate, as date is only used in the shift, and therefore had no reason to be broken out. I implemented inheritance in the message class through a parent message class and child encrypted and decrypted message classes.


*Ruby Conventions and Mechanics*

I would say that all my ruby mechanics and conventions are good. My code is organized well and my naming is almost completely self-evident. I think that I have maybe one or two methods of 11 or 12 lines. Otherwise, every method is shorter than 10. I used a hash, but it was the one in the project requirements so I'm not sure that counts... In any case, to use a hash the way that I constructed the project would have been counterproductive. I would be comfortable saying all my enumerables are the most efficient.


*Test Driven Development*

I was very careful to write my tests before I wrote my code, even when I felt it was stifling to a roll I was on or my creative process. I don't think I have tests that are completely free from reliance on functionality from other classes. My test coverage shows like 97.5% or so, but for some reason it is incorporating a test into the code that is supposed to be tested, so I wouldn't be surprised if the overall number is closer to 99%, but perhaps not over.


*Version Control*

Another part of the project I was very careful about. I am not so good at remembering to commit constantly, so this was something I paid attention to and tried to execute to the best of my ability. I broke up all the pull requests into logical parts--usually by class.
